# Quiz Bot with Mistral 7B

## Overview

This project is a quiz bot powered by the Mistral 7B language model, currently running locally using Llama-cpp-python. The goal is to host this bot for users to have access to a free, easy to use study bot.

The bot generates quiz questions and answers based on user prompts, and will also have RAG implemented to allow for users to insert study material to be quizzed on.
